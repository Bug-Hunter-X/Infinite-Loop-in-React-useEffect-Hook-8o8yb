This repository demonstrates a common error in React's useEffect hook:  forgetting to include state variables in the dependency array. This results in an infinite loop because the effect runs on every render, constantly updating the state and triggering re-renders. The solution shows how adding `count` to the dependency array correctly limits the effect's execution to only when the `count` value changes.
